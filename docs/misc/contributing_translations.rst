Contributing translations
=========================

There are two preferred ways to contribute translations:

Via DVCS
========

If your are a (Django-)developer you might want to fork django-lfs and
lfs-theme on `GitHub <https://github.com/diefenbach>`_ add the translations as
`used to <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/translation/#localization-how-to-create-language-files>`_,
commit them and send us a pull request.

.. Note::

    Please make sure to fork the correct version branch.

Via Transifex
=============

If your are a translator you can just go to `transifex
<https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/lfs/>`_, choose or add the language of
your choice and start to translate via the web interface. Once you are ready we
would add your translations to the source code.

.. Note::

    Please make sure to use the correct version.

Other
=====

If none of these fit your workflow you can of course just send us the
translation files.
