Vouchers
========

Vouchers are another possibility to give a price reduction for customers. The
price reduction can be absolute or percentaged based on the total cart price.

They are generic character strings which can be distributed to customers. If a
valid voucher string is entered within the cart or as part of the checkout
process the customer gets the price reduction.

Vouchers can be limited by a start and an end date or a minimum cart price.

Vouchers expire when they have been used for a certain amount of times. A common
way is to expire the voucher right after it has been used the first time.

The shop owner can add an arbitrary amount of vouchers. They can be of the same
or of different types.
