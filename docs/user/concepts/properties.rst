This section describes the concepts of properties.

Overview
========

Generally, properties are used to extend products with miscellaneous data fields.
Properties are attached to products with the help of :doc:`property groups
</user/management/properties/property_groups>`.

In particular properties are used to create :doc:`products with variants
</user/howtos/how_to_variants>`, :doc:`configurable products
</user/howtos/how_to_configurable_product>` and :doc:`filters
</user/howtos/how_to_filters>` or just to display generic information on a product.
Additionally they can also be used to ask the shop customers to enter
information for a product which is about to be ordered.
