Portlets
========

This section describes the concept of portlets in general and the default
portlets in detail.

Overview
========

A Portlet is a piece of arbitrary information which can be assigned to every
object, like shop, products, categories and pages. They are displayed in
:term:`slots`. A slot can have an arbitrary amount of Portlets. LFS ships with a
left and a right slot and several default portlets. By default portlets are
inherited from parent objects but it is also possible to block parent portlets
per slot.

The inheritance path for categories and products is::

    shop > category > sub category > product

The inheritance path for pages is::

    shop > page root > page

Default Portlets

settings and properties.
