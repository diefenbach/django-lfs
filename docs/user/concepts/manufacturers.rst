This section describes the concepts of manufacturers.

Overview
========

Manufacturers are bound directly to the :doc:`products <products>` that are sold at the shop.

Every manufacturer can have zero or more products assigned. Each product can have zero or one manufacturer.

There is a page that lists all the manufacturers defined in the system. In order to use it
at your shop you have to add new :doc:`action <actions>` pointing to **/manufacturers** url.
From this page, users can dig deeper to see all the products from the specific manufacturer.

Please see the description of the :doc:`Manufacturers Management Interface </user/management/shop/manufacturers>`
in order to see more details of the information manufacturers provide.
