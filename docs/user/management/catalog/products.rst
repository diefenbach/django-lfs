    page, within overviews and as part of the HTML meta title tag.

Slug
    The last part of the product's URL. This must be unique.

Redirect to
    If the product is not active and this field is filled the user is redirected
    to the given URL. This might be useful if your product has been indexed by
    search engines but is not available any more. Note: super users are not
    redirected.

SKU
    Your unique product id.

Manufacturer

    complete (start typing to see hints).

    The price of the product. Whether this price is considered net or gross
    dependents on the selected price calculator for a product (see

Price Calculation

    .. warning::

        This is experimental feature. Use it with care and take notice that
        these could be replaced with something different in future.

    .. note::

        This is only available for ``Configurable Products``.

    If the check box is checked the input field could contain a formula to
    calculate the price of a ``Configurable Product``. In this case one can
    refer to the values of a property in order to calculate the price.

    Generally the formula could contain any valid Python expression which is
    able to be evaluated with ``eval`` with two additionally tokens.

    If an error, occurs the default price of the product is taken.

    Available tokens::

        product(<attribute>)
            Refers to the attribute of the current product

        property(<id>)
            Refers to the value of the property with the given <id>

    Example 1::

        property(15) * product(price)

    Which means: take the entered value of the property with the id 15 and
    multiply it with the product's price.

    Example 2::

        product(price) * property(54) * property(55) + property(56)

    Which means: multiply the product's price with the values of the properties
    with ids 54, 55 and add the value of the property with the id 56.

Price calculator
    Determines how the product price is calculated using the product price and
    tax stored in the database. If you leave this field blank, your pricing
    calculator will default to the shop :ref:`price calculator
    <preferences_default_values>`.

    LFS ships with two pricing calculator methods: ``Price Includes Tax``, which
    means the product price in the database includes tax and ``Price Excludes
    Tax``, which means the product price in the database excludes tax.

For sale
    If the check box is activated the entered for sale price is active. On all
    views the standard price is displayed stroked and the for sale price is
    displayed emphasized.

    For variants following is true:

    Standard
        Inherits the ``for sale`` state of the base article.

    Yes
        Variant is for sale.

    No
        Variant is not for sale.

Quantity field unit
    This is displayed before the quantity field of the product within the
    product detail view and after the product amount within cart and order
    items.

Type of quantity field
    There are three types of quantity fields: ``Integer``, which means the
    quantity must be an integer and all decimal places are ignored. ``Decimal
    0.1``, which means the quantity must be a decimal number with one place and
    more decimal places are ignored. ``Decimal 0.01``, which means the quantity
    must be a decimal number with two places and more decimal places are ignored.

    product detail view and category products view.

    For variants following is true:
