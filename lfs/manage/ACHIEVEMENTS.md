    ### ‚úÖ Delete Confirmation Modal System
    - **Universal Modal Implementation**: Implemented consistent delete confirmation modals across all management areas
    - **Static Blocks**: Added `StaticBlockDeleteConfirmView` with modal template and HTMX integration
    - **Actions**: Added `ActionDeleteConfirmView` replacing `hx-confirm` with proper modal dialog
    - **Voucher Groups**: Added `VoucherGroupDeleteConfirmView` with warning about voucher deletion
    - **Consistent UX**: All delete operations now use the same modal pattern for better user experience

    ### ‚úÖ Delete View Refactoring
    - **Simplified Architecture**: Refactored all delete views to use simple `post()` methods instead of complex Django DeleteView inheritance
    - **Message Handling**: Fixed success message timing - messages now appear correctly after deletion
    - **Redirect Logic**: Streamlined redirect handling for better user flow
    - **HTMX Integration**: Modal opening uses HTMX, actual deletion uses classic form submission

    ### ‚úÖ Template Architecture
    - **Modal Templates**: Created dedicated delete confirmation templates for each area
    - **Modal Integration**: Added `modal-sm.html` includes to all relevant management templates
    - **Button Updates**: Converted all delete buttons from `hx-confirm` to proper modal triggers
    - **Consistent Styling**: All modals follow the same design pattern with warning icons and clear messaging

    ### ‚úÖ URL Structure Enhancement
    - **Confirmation URLs**: Added new URL patterns for delete confirmation views
    - **RESTful Design**: Maintained clean URL structure with separate confirmation and deletion endpoints
    - **Backward Compatibility**: Existing delete URLs still work for direct deletion

    ### ‚úÖ Test Suite Updates
    - **Unit Tests**: Updated all delete view tests to match new implementation
    - **E2E Tests**: All Playwright tests pass with new modal interactions
    - **Message Mocking**: Added proper message framework mocking in tests
    - **Response Assertions**: Updated test assertions for new response types

    ### üìä Code Quality Metrics
    - **Tests**: 46/46 Voucher view tests passing ‚úÖ
    - **Tests**: 35/35 Action view tests passing ‚úÖ
    - **Tests**: All Static Block E2E tests passing ‚úÖ
    - **Coverage**: Complete test coverage for all delete confirmation functionality
    - **Linting**: No linter errors across all modified files

    ### üéØ Key Technical Decisions
    1. **Modal over Confirm**: Replaced browser `confirm()` dialogs with proper Bootstrap modals
    2. **HTMX for UX**: Used HTMX only for modal loading, not for actual deletion
    3. **Classic Forms**: Used traditional form submission for reliable delete operations
    4. **Message Timing**: Fixed message display by setting them before object deletion
    5. **Consistent Patterns**: Applied the same implementation pattern across all areas

    ### üîÑ Architecture Improvements
    - **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between modal display (HTMX) and deletion (Django)
    - **User Safety**: Better confirmation dialogs with clear warnings about data loss
    - **Maintainable Code**: Consistent implementation pattern makes future changes easier
    - **Error Prevention**: Proper modal dialogs reduce accidental deletions

    ### üöÄ User Experience Enhancements
    - **Better Confirmations**: Rich modal dialogs instead of basic browser alerts
    - **Clear Warnings**: Specific messages about what will be deleted (e.g., "This will also delete all vouchers")
    - **Visual Feedback**: Success messages appear consistently after deletions
    - **Consistent Interface**: Same modal pattern across all management areas

    ### ‚úÖ Backend Search Implementation
    - **StaticBlocks Search**: Implemented backend-powered search functionality replacing JavaScript filtering
    - Added `get_static_blocks_queryset()` method to `StaticBlockTabMixin`
    - Integrated HTMX for seamless search experience
    - Added search parameter persistence across tab navigation
    - Enhanced template with proper HTMX triggers and targets

    - **Actions Search**: Implemented backend search for Action management
    - Added `get_action_groups_queryset()` method to `ActionUpdateView`
    - Intelligent group filtering - only shows groups with matching actions
    - Maintained drag & drop functionality during search operations
    - Search persistence across action navigation

    ### ‚úÖ HTMX Strategy Refinement
    - **Selective HTMX Usage**: Made strategic decisions about when to use HTMX vs classical Django patterns
    - **Search**: HTMX for smooth, real-time filtering
    - **Forms**: Classical Django for reliability with Messages framework
    - **File Management**: HTMX for better UX without page reloads

    ### ‚úÖ Messages Framework Integration
    - **Success Messages**: Added Django Messages for user feedback
    - Action save operations: "Action has been saved."
    - Action creation: "Action has been added."
    - Action deletion: "Action has been deleted."
    - **Template Integration**: Leveraged existing manage_base.html message display with auto-dismiss

    ### ‚úÖ Test Suite Maintenance
    - **Test Fixes**: Updated 35 Action view tests for new implementation
    - Fixed request object handling in test methods
    - Added proper mocking for Django Messages framework
    - Updated assertions for changed response types (HTMX vs Redirect)
    - **Backend Search Tests**: Added comprehensive test coverage
    - Tests for filtered and unfiltered querysets
    - Search parameter handling in context data
    - URL generation with search parameters

    ### ‚úÖ Architecture Improvements
    - **Clean Separation**: Clear distinction between search (HTMX) and CRUD (Classical Django)
    - **Maintainable Code**: Simplified JavaScript by removing client-side search complexity
    - **Performance**: Database-level filtering instead of DOM manipulation
    - **Scalability**: Search functionality works efficiently with large datasets

    ### üìä Code Quality Metrics
    - **Tests**: 35/35 Action view tests passing ‚úÖ
    - **Coverage**: All new search functionality thoroughly tested
    - **Linting**: No linter errors across modified files
    - **Performance**: Backend filtering significantly faster than client-side

    ### üéØ Key Technical Decisions
    1. **Backend over Frontend**: Moved search logic from JavaScript to Django for better performance
    2. **Messages over HTMX Events**: Used Django's proven Messages framework instead of custom HTMX solutions
    3. **Progressive Enhancement**: HTMX for UX improvements, not core functionality
    4. **Test-Driven**: All changes backed by comprehensive test coverage

    ### üîÑ Refactoring Highlights
    - Cleaned up ActionUpdateView and action templates
    - Removed unnecessary JavaScript complexity
    - Streamlined HTMX usage to essential features only
    - Enhanced template organization and readability
