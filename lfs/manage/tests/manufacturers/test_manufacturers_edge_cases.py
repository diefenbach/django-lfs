"""
Comprehensive edge case tests for manufacturer management.

Following TDD principles:
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Clear test names describing expected behavior
- Arrange-Act-Assert structure
- One assertion per test (when practical)
- Fast tests with minimal mocking

Tests cover:
- Boundary conditions and edge cases
- Error handling and validation
- Invalid input handling
- Race conditions
- Database integrity
- Permission edge cases
