"""
Syntax and code quality tests for manufacturer management.

Following TDD principles:
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Clear test names describing expected behavior
- Arrange-Act-Assert structure
- One assertion per test (when practical)
- Fast tests with minimal mocking

Tests cover:
- Import statements and module loading
- Class and function definitions
- Method signatures and parameters
- Code style and conventions
- Error handling patterns
