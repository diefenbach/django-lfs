"""
Comprehensive syntax and import tests for featured module.

Following TDD principles:
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Clear test names describing expected behavior
- Arrange-Act-Assert structure
- One assertion per test (when practical)
- Fast tests with minimal mocking

Tests cover:
- Import validation for all featured module components
- Syntax validation of Python files
- URL configuration validation
- Template path validation
- Module structure validation
