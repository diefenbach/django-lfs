"""
Edge cases and boundary condition tests for featured products.

Following TDD principles:
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Clear test names describing expected behavior
- Arrange-Act-Assert structure
- One assertion per test (when practical)
- Fast tests with minimal mocking

Tests cover:
- Boundary conditions and edge cases
- Error handling and recovery
- Invalid inputs and malformed data
- Resource constraints and limits
- Race conditions and concurrency
- Data integrity and consistency
