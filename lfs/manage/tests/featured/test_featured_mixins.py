"""
Comprehensive unit tests for featured mixins.

Following TDD principles:
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Clear test names describing expected behavior
- Arrange-Act-Assert structure
- One assertion per test (when practical)
- Fast tests with minimal mocking

Tests cover:
- Mixin functionality and method behavior
- Mixin composition and inheritance
- Method overriding and calling super()
- Integration with views and other components

NOTE: Currently, the featured module does not have any dedicated mixins.
This file serves as a template for when mixins are added to the featured module.
