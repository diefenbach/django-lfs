"""
Comprehensive integration tests for featured views.

Following TDD principles:
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Clear test names describing expected behavior
- Arrange-Act-Assert structure
- One assertion per test (when practical)
- Fast tests with minimal mocking

Tests cover:
- End-to-end view interactions
- Request/response cycles
- Session state management
- Database state changes
- Template rendering and context
- URL resolution and redirection
