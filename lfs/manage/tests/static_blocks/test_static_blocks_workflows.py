"""
Workflow tests for static_blocks.

Following TDD principles:
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Clear test names describing expected behavior
- Arrange-Act-Assert structure
- One assertion per test (when practical)
- Fast tests with minimal mocking

Tests cover:
- Complete user workflows
- Integration between views and models
- End-to-end functionality
- Business logic validation
